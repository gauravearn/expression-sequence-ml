# machine_learning_automated_framework_expression_sequences
a automated framework for the sequence to expression machine learning. it takes the fasta sequences, expression  file from the expression analysis and then writes the pickle file: a automated framework for the sequence to expression machine learning. it takes the fasta sequences, expression file from the expression analysis and then writes the pickle file for the automated machine learning. It goes through all the classifier and gives you all the classifier and you can select the one based on the precision and accuracy call. It writes pickle file with the highest protocol.
